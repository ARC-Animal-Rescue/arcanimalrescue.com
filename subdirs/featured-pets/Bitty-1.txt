Needed most right NOW is a short-term foster for these two SUPER FRIENDLY, young, TINY boys until we can identify a long term foster and/or adopter.
<br><br>
Because they are the GOLDEN TRIFECTA, we DO anticipate they should go very fast:  They are YOUNG, they are FRIENDLY, they love other dogs, cats, & adults, (older kids, too!)
<br><br>
Because they are HIGHLY socialized, we would LOVE to place them in a home where there are adults home all day- either a retired couple or where someone is working from home on the computer.  Because they're bonded, they must go together as a pair.  They are SUPER LOVING and actively want to BE WITH PEOPLE all the time- they are simply a Home Entertainment Center, lol!  Its just delightful to watch them playing together!
