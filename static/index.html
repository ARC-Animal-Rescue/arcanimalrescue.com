            <h1 class="heading"> NOVA </h1>
		<h2> Meet Nova! </h2>
			<p>Beautiful, classic Doggo girl, over a year old, healthy, friendly, spayed, up to date on all vaccinations. Lots of basic training under her belt, adoptions only AVAILABLE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY, CA!
			Nova arrives with a complete trousseau, including bedding, doggy-wear, toys, bowls, treat bags, and much, much more.  We have invested a great deal into this valuable beauty.

			As you see in the photos, Nova is LOVING and GREAT with well-bred teenagers, too!

			While deafness can be a recessive trait for Doggos:  We GUARANTEE that this VERY GOOD GIRL is absolutely not deaf at all.  In fact, she can hear a food wrapper anywhere on your property, lol! Food driven and highly trainable.  Our rescue will only consider families experienced with Doggo Argentinos/similar breeds. Please do your research before contacting us.

			While we have no papers on Nova, she certainly APPEARS to conform to the traditional standards of excellence- we have observed many of the traditional genetic, behavioral traits and characteristics of Doggos in this beauty!</p>

She’s so patient too, we are thankful that she came to our family, she’s the perfect fit for us and I’m most certain she’s totally bonded with us as well.   Thanks again for helping us bring her into our family.Dear ARC:  I couldn’t resist sending these photos to you of the wonderful girl dog we adopted through ARC! Lucy is 100% our girl.

            <i>This is the “ARC” of the lives of the pets whom we intake:  Our Rescue specializes in highly vulnerable pets, at immediate risk of euthanasia for medical, behavioural and other situational emergency circumstances.  We have also provided support services for the disabled, elderly and low income pet families on a case by case basis.  Without our ability to react quickly, virtually every single pet whose lives we have touched would be dead.   The arc of their lives often begins at the cusp of certain death and transitions into these same pets as treasured and adored family members!</i>
